This is the role of fire detection and   alarm systems. Depending on the anticipated fire scenario, building and   use type, number and type of occupants, and criticality of contents and   mission, these systems can provide several main functions. First they   provide a means to identify a developing fire through either manual or   automatic methods and second, they alert building occupants to a fire   condition and the need to evacuate. Another common function is the   transmission of an alarm notification signal to the fire department or   other emergency response organization. They may also shut down   electrical, air handling equipment or special process operations, and   they may be used to initiate automatic suppression systems. This section   will describe the basic aspects of fire detection and alarm systems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor most fires, water represents the ideal extinguishing agent. Fire   sprinklers utilize water by direct application onto flames and heat,   which causes cooling of the combustion process and prevents ignition of   adjacent combustibles. They are most effective during the fire''s initial   flame growth stage, while the fire is relatively easy to control. A   properly selected sprinkler will detect the fire''s heat, initiate alarm,   and begin suppression within moments after flames appear. In most   instances sprinklers will control fire advancement within a few minutes   of their activation, which will in turn result in significantly less   damage than otherwise would happen without sprinklers.</p>\r\n		  </td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n	</tbody>\r\n</table>', 1),

In the 1940s,   computers were so large that individual rooms had to be specially set   aside to house them. Even the steady miniaturization of the computer did   not initially change this arrangement because the functional scope   increased to such an extent that the systems still required the same   amount of space. Even today, with individual PCs being much more   powerful than any mainframe system from those days, every large-scale   operation has complex IT infrastructures with a substantial amount of   hardware &ndash; and they are still housed in properly outfitted rooms.   Depending on their size, these are referred to as &ldquo;server rooms&rdquo; or   &ldquo;data centers.&rdquo;<br />\r\n        <img src="images/datacenter.jpg" width="324" height="202" align="right" style="padding:10px;"/><br />\r\n        Imperial Techsol is an innovative legacy/SDN hybrid switch, installed with   open-architecture powerful Imperial Techsol network operating system, which   supports many legacy L2/L3 protocols and state-of-the-art OpenFlow   features with line-rate traffic. MT198T is equipped with 48 ports 10GbE   SFP+ and 6 40GbE QSFP ports, specifically designed for the use of   Top-of-Rack (ToR) switches, enterprise Layer-3 switches, and telecom   monitoring/tapping networks.

It also supports L2/L3 protocols commonly used in data center   and enterprise; thus it is also a cost-effective switch solution in   legacy networks. MT198T therefor provides a progressive and feasible way   for networking systems from the legacy mode migrating to SDN.<br />\r\n        <br />\r\n    Computers, of course, require electricity, as well as protection from   theft and the accidental or intentional manipulation of hardware. Put   simply, one has to safeguard data centers against external influences   and provide them with sufficient cooling. After all, there is a lot of   powerful hardware sitting in one place.</p>    \r\n      <p>In addition to these &ldquo;hard&rdquo; factors, one must also take into   consideration organizational measures, such as periodic backups that   ensure operability. As a rule, the more extensive and critical the   hardware and software become, the more time and effort are required to   provide optimal protection.</p>\r\n      <p>For that reason, a data center preferably consists of a   well-constructed, sturdy building that houses servers, storage devices,   cables, and a connection to the Internet. In addition, the center also   has a large amount of equipment associated with supplying power and   cooling, and often automatic fire extinguishing systems.</p></td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n</table>', 1),

(8, 'Private Placements under New Companies Act 2013', '<p align="center">\r\n	<strong>PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS OF PRIVATE PLACEMENT UNDER THE COMPANIES ACT, 2013</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>Introduction</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n	&nbsp;The procedural requirements and compliance under the Private placement have undergone drastic changes under the Companies Act, 2013 (the Act) and the Rules relating to the private placement have been notified w.e.f. 1st April, 2014 under the Companies (Prospectus and Allotment of Securities) Rules, 2014. Private placement is one of the important routes for raising funds by the companies- it being the fastest, as it bye-passes certain compliance requirements under the strict Regulatory procedures. Further, under the Companies Act, 1956, the conditions relating to private placement were applicable only to public companies whereas, in the present Act, the private placement of shares and debentures shall be applicable to both, private limited companies as well as to public companies.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>Private placement of securities</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Securities mean equity shares, preference shares, debentures, convertible instruments and redeemable instruments. The Act uses the words issue of securities and not shares. Thus, it has wide coverage and includes almost all the instruments and other marketable securities as mentioned above.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>Provisions of Private Placement under the Companies Act, 2013</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>3. </strong>Chapter III, Part II of the Act, 2013 deals with the provisions related to the private placement of securities. Further, section 42 of the Act contains the provisions relating to offer or invitation for subscription to securities on private placement.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Private Placement is defined under the <em>Explanation</em> II to section 42, which reads as follows:&mdash;</p>\r\n<p style="margin-left:22.65pt;">\r\n	&quot;any offer of securities or invitation to subscribe to securities to a select group of persons by a company (other than by way of public offer) through issue of a private placement offer letter and which satisfies the conditions specified in this section&quot;. Further, as per section 42(2)(1), the offer of securities or invitation to subscribe to securities shall be made to such number of persons not exceeding fifty or such higher number as may be prescribed (excluding qualified institutional buyers and employees of the company being offered securities under a scheme of employees stock option(ESOP) as per provisions of clause (b) of sub-section (1) of section 62), in a financial year and on such conditions (including the form and manner of private placement) as may be prescribed.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Thus, it can be concluded that issuance of ESOPs, Rights Issues, securities offered through public issues, Depository Receipts issued outside India, foreign securities have different norms to be followed and will not be under the Private Placement norms. These private placement norms shall be applicable if the offer is made to a person who is currently not an equity shareholder of the company.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>Deemed to be an offer to the Public</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>4. </strong>As per Section 42(4) of the Act, any offer or invitation not in compliance with the provisions of this Section shall be treated as a public offer and all the provisions of this Act, and the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 (42 of 1956) (SCRA) and the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (15 of 1992) (SEBI) are required to be complied with. This provision has been introduced in order to plug the loophole wherein Sahara had issued hybrid instruments to several lakhs of investors and yet claimed that SEBI did not have jurisdiction. The case related to Sahara is known to everybody. For the sake of brevity the same has not been repeated herein.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Further, the <em>Explanation</em> I to section 42 of the Act clearly states that if a company, whether listed or unlisted, makes an offer to allot or invites subscription or allots or enters into an agreement to allot securities to more than the prescribed number of persons, whether the payment for the securities has been received or not or whether the company intends to list out its securities or not on any recognized stock exchange in or outside India, the same shall be deemed to be an offer to the public and shall, accordingly, be governed by the provisions of Part I of the Chapter, <em>i.e.,</em> will come under the clutches of the SEBI and the SCRA.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>Operative portion of the section</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>5. </strong>Private Placement provision stipulates that all monies payable towards subscription of securities by private placement shall be paid through cheque or demand draft or through other banking channels but not by cash. Further, a company making an offer or invitation under this section shall allot its securities within a period of 60 days from the receipt of application money. If the company is not able to allot the securities within the specified period, the application money is to be refunded within a period of 15 days from completion of 60 days. The money raised by the issue of offer or invitation shall be in a separate bank account and cannot be used until allotted. However, the said money can be utilised for adjustment against allotment of securities or for the repayment of monies where the company is unable to allot securities.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>Restrictions on issue of private placement</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>6. </strong>(<em>a</em>) No fresh offer or invitation under private placement is possible unless the allotments with respect to any offer made earlier have been completed or that offer or invitation has been withdrawn or abandoned by the company.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	(<em>b</em>) All offers under the private placement route shall be made only to such persons whose names are recorded by the company prior to the invitation to subscribe and that such persons shall receive the offer by name, and that a complete record of such offers shall be kept by the company in such manner as may be prescribed and complete information about such offer shall be filed with the Registrar within a period of 30 days of circulation of relevant private placement offer letter.
